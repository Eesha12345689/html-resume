<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a mathematician or that's what I want to be. I did homeschooling from about mid grade 2 all the way to grade 5. I went to school in grade 6, but then I went back to homeschooling in grade 7 and grade 8, and then, being left with barely a choice, (not that I diskliked school, just stating it out there) I did go to highschool in grade 9, fun fact, I am in grade 7 CURRENTLY, 13 years old, just writing the furture plan, like it is the past so it is easier to read so keep that in mind, however the math thingy, that part is finalized... so don't get exactly confused.</p>

<p>Anyway, you're not going to SEE THIS COMING!! From age 10-12 years (12 years 11 months and 27 days to be precise!) I did proffesional chess peaking with a 1681 FIDE rating and like I quit it for it's risks and soooo on. I got pnemonia actually which influenced it as after the break I did some research on Chess and figured all the bad things, with the percentage being VERY slim to suceed, nonetheless, my main concern was it's risks and if it's really a lucrative career, also, only about 700 milion, let's call in a bilion, people know chess whereas 6-7 bilion people (out of the 8 bilion people alive) know math, so I'll probably be more famous, about that penomnia now.</p>
<p>I was sick with pnemonia from December 31st. Technically, it started off as a fever, and it became SUPER high temprature, 104 degrees to be precise, I had a chess tournament on January 4th, after requesting several times, I went to that tournament sick, with a burning fever and dizzy, sleepy mind, scoring a measly 2.5/5, after we went to the walk-in clinic, the day after, they prescribe an antibiotic, azithr... which I took but didn't help. We went to the emergeny and they gave IV + Amoxilin tablets. THEN at aroun January mid closer to the end I healed. Full at Feb 1st. Today it's Tuesday March 18th 2025, 3:15 p.m and my grandparents are coming from india to cananda on Thursday, March 20th, 5:15 pm, 2025 so I'm excited. I'm doing coding as a hobby, so that's where this whole text started. It's completly true, that's my whole life, well the last 3 months of my whole life + a sentence on chess, which I did for 3 years. Sooooo... HA!!</p>
