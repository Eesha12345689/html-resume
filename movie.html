<h1>Some of the BEST movies(and one show) according to superstar Eesha</h1>
 <h2>Top 3 movies  ALL-time(including one show)</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>MEGAN</h3>
 <p>
    This is honestly an amazing movie, talking about the danger of AI, and how a child, who lost her parents is looking for a 
    friend. Her aunt (basically adpots her) finds a very very inventive way to do so. MUST watch, amazing thriller with a very slight touch of horror, but if you are terrified of horror movies, you are STILL in luck, this is not exactly like a ghost movies but it does involve MURDER.
 </p>
 <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
 <p>
    Plunging into the magic realm, this series of books translated into a series of movies is absoultly wild
    as Harry Potter is discovering his magic abilities using a wand and fights of the villan that killed his parents, being
    protected at a small age by love. This movie is never too old or too young!
 </p>
 <h3>Zootopia but this movie is tied with another move The Hunger Games</h3>
 <p>These polar opposite movies are actually AMAZING! Zootopia, a police bunny working with a con artist fox to solve the case
    of some weird animals, while The Hunger Games also a series of movies, is a girl having to survive in BRUTAL challenges, having to kill others for TV to live.
    However the latter is actually not recomended for anyone below 15 or 16 while zootopia is honestly for any age.

 <h2>THE SHOW</h2>
 <h3>Queen's Gambit</h3>
 <p>This is honestly such a great show I couldn't resist adding it, it's a series of videos or like a series of very long videos 
    about an orphan discovering chess and crushing everyone overcoming bias and sexism and using creativity and imagination to DESTROY EVERYONE 
    in this magnificent game. It does involve her having bad habits at first so I think 14+.
