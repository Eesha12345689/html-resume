<h1>Things that you'll never know about me</h1>
<hr />
<p>I spent years training in chess, chasing the GM title, but somewhere between blunders and brilliancies, I realized my true endgame—math and securing a career that actually pays (FAANG or finance, obviously). If it’s not $400K+, it’s not worth my time. <br /> <hr />

    I have a cockapoo sidekick who keeps me company during my adventures, and soon, I’ll have a smart, independent cat to complete my empire. Also, I’m writing a story where snake dragons exist, because reality could use some upgrades, and who doesn’t love a good plot twist? <br /> <hr />
    
    I’m allergic to mushrooms (don’t even think about it), but I’ve got good memories that keep me laughing and inspired. I can recall the tiniest details, which comes in handy for everything from chess strategies to my favorite plot points in books. <br /> <hr />
    
    Sunscreen? Allergic. Distractions? Annoying. Explanations? Clear and to the point. I like my books fast-paced, my goals sky-high, and my life on track for success—no detours, no nonsense. I’m super confident, brave, and totally awe-inspiring, ready to take on the world and leave my mark. ✨ <br /> <hr />
    
    Oh, and let’s talk about how everyone messes up my name—seriously, it’s a talent! They tremble in my presence because, let’s face it, I’m just too cool. I thrive on movement, love late nights, and enjoy an early rise. With my doodle board, I craft stories on the spot, drawing characters and spinning tales like a pro. My amazing family supports my ambitions, helping me push through challenges and fueling my drive to explore the world.</p> <hr/>
